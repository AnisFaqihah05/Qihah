      <p>&#127808; Hello and thank you for stopping by! I'm Anis Faqihah Binti Mohd Hanapiah, and I'm excited to share a little bit about myself with you here..</p>

      </div>
    
      <p> &#127808; I'm from the state of Melaka, which is famous for its rare histories that exist in Malaysia. I'm an ambivert, where there are times when I like to go out to meet friends and times when I don't want to meet people at all.</p> 
	<br>
      <p>&#127808; Every time I come back from university, I always ask my ummi to cook my favorite food, which is Asam Pedas and Sambal Udang. Besides that, every time I go back to my hometown in Negeri Sembilan, I will buy pulut made by Oghang Nogori. Pulut consists of glutinous rice, coconut flakes, and sambal petai. I am also a coffee lover. I drink all kinds of coffee, including amaricano, but my choice is toasted almond coffee because of the soft roasted nut aroma and delicious creamy taste </P>

      <h2>&#127807;Family &#127807; </h2>
      <p>I love my family so much!!! My parents always support me and are always there for me, even though I always make trouble. From childhood to adulthood, they always make sure my needs are enough, whatever I want they give me even more in terms of food. My mother always cooks me Asam Pedas Ikan Pari. Meanwhile, my father always takes me to our favorite place to eat, which is Mee Bodoh Tengkera in Melaka.</p>

      <img src="gambar/familypic.jpg" alt="Family Photo" width="400">

      <p>I have four siblings, I am the oldest. I have two younger brothers and a younger sister. The first younger brother,Adib, was born in 2007, while the second, Ariq, was born in 2011. They are very naughty, but I am lucky because when they do something wrong, my parents will not blame me, unlike other parents. But they are also the ones I always rely on to take care of my parents and my little sister when I am away from home. They are stubborn but at the same time they are also useful sometimes. It is normal for siblings, there are times when they fight and there are times when they make up. However, I still love them (sometimes &#128580;)</p>

      </div>
      <p> My younger sister was born in 2024, 19 years apart from me. I know you must think it's far away...but when I think back, it's normal because my mother and her sister are 18 years apart. The worst thing is that my younger sister was born when I was taking the final test for the subject IMC 111. I didn't know when I was going to take the exam, because I had mixed feelings. But my younger sister was born safely and was named Afya. I like to call her CikMok because she's small and fluffy.</p>

      <h2>&#127804;Ma Homies&#127804;</h2>
      <p>I have many acquaintances, but only one can be called a friend. I say this because she is the only one who is still in touch with me to this day. Even though we are far apart, we don't always call or chat, but she still makes me feel comfortable every time we meet.</p>
      <div class="image-container">

      </div>
      <p>Her name is An'nur Farisya Najwa Zahreen. She's the only friend who has been friends with me since we were 10 years old until now. She is a happy person but has never been stingy with me. She is beautiful, kind and strong to face everything. She was also a successful swimmer when we were in high school.</p>
	<br>
      <p>I don't want to say that my acquaintances at school and University are not my friends... There are many, but I can't call them friends yet. Because people come and go. They leave many sweet memories throughout my life. It's usual in life, but I am grateful to have met many acquaintances who always help me, no matter if it is about money or tasks. Like Najihah, Fatin, Sufi, Nisa and many others, they don't mind giving me help.</p>

      </div>
      <p>I love and appreciate everyone who helps me, gives me advice, and makes me think mature. They also always express and share their life stories with me, which makes me grateful for my life and makes me more mature and think before acting.</p>

      <h3>Short Story</h3>
      <p>I have one story... in the 3rd semester, my friend and I went to bathe at the eco park. I told my mom, she said "okay". And then I called my mom and said I was tired of bathing near the rapids area. Then she got angry, even though the night before I went, she said okay Tauuuuu. She must have thought I was walking there instead of bathing there (telling with a sad heart)</p>
